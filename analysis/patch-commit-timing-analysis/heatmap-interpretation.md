# Temporal Analysis of Security Fix Commits: Patterns and Implications

## Overview

Our analysis examined the temporal distribution of 6,735 security fix commits across various open-source projects, representing 14.42% of the total CVEs analyzed. This comprehensive dataset reveals distinct patterns in when security practitioners typically deploy vulnerability fixes, offering valuable insights for security monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Key Findings

### Working vs. Non-Working Hours

A significant majority (58.07%) of security fixes occur outside traditional working hours (9 AM - 5 PM UTC, Monday-Friday). This pattern likely reflects both the global nature of open-source development and the urgency often associated with security vulnerabilities, where fixes are deployed as soon as they are ready, regardless of local time.

### Daily Distribution

The data shows a clear weekly pattern in fix deployment:

1. Highest activity: Tuesday (1,242 commits)
2. Second highest: Wednesday (1,171 commits)
3. Third highest: Monday (1,150 commits)
4. Fourth highest: Thursday (1,115 commits)
5. Lowest weekday activity: Friday (1,005 commits)

This distribution suggests a preference for mid-week deployments, possibly balancing the need for immediate security fixes with the desire to have team support available for any potential issues.

### Hourly Patterns

Peak activity occurs during a concentrated period in UTC time:

1. 14:00 UTC (434 commits)
2. 16:00 UTC (424 commits)
3. 15:00 UTC (388 commits)
4. 12:00 UTC (364 commits)
5. 13:00 UTC (361 commits)

This clustering around UTC afternoon hours likely represents an overlap of working hours across major global development regions (morning in Americas, late afternoon in Europe, and evening in Asia).

## Implications for Security Analysis

### Baseline Establishment

These patterns establish a baseline for typical security fix deployment timing. Significant deviations from these patterns—such as clusters of commits at unusual hours—could serve as one indicator among many for identifying potentially suspicious activity.

### Risk Assessment Context

The high proportion of off-hours commits suggests that security response teams must maintain vigilance outside standard working hours. However, this also means that off-hours commits alone cannot be considered inherently suspicious, as they represent a normal pattern in security fix deployment.

### Model Feature Development

For machine learning applications focused on identifying malicious commits, these temporal patterns should be considered as one feature within a broader analysis framework. The time of commit should be evaluated in context with other indicators such as:

- Code complexity and structure changes
- Author reputation and history
- Commit message characteristics
- File modification patterns
- Integration with existing security workflows

## Methodological Considerations

The analysis is based on UTC timestamps, which may mask some regional patterns. Additionally, the dataset represents only publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with identifiable fix commits, suggesting potential selection bias toward more formal security processes and larger projects.

## Conclusions

The temporal distribution of security fix commits reveals clear patterns that can inform both human analysis and automated security tools. However, these patterns should be interpreted as guidelines rather than strict rules, and temporal analysis should be integrated with other security metrics for comprehensive threat assessment.
