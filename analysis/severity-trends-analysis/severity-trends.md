# Severity Trends Analysis

The data presents a comprehensive view of cybersecurity vulnerabilities over a seven-year period, with notable trends in both total volume and severity distribution.

## Total Vulnerability Trends

The overall number of vulnerabilities shows a marked increase from 2020 onward, with significant volatility in the measurements. The baseline of approximately 200-300 vulnerabilities per period in 2017-2019 escalated to peaks exceeding 800 vulnerabilities in later years, with particularly pronounced spikes in 2024.

## Severity Distribution Analysis

The vulnerabilities are categorized into four severity levels: Critical, High, Low, and Medium. High-severity vulnerabilities consistently represent the largest proportion throughout the period, typically accounting for 40-50% of all reported vulnerabilities. Medium-severity issues maintain a steady presence in the upper portion of the distribution, while Low-severity vulnerabilities show moderate fluctuation but remain relatively stable.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

The proportion of critical vulnerabilities, noted at 18.6%, represents a significant security concern. These critical issues show periodic spikes throughout the timeline, though their relative frequency appears to have stabilized in recent periods despite the overall increase in total vulnerabilities.

## Temporal Patterns

A notable inflection point occurs around 2020-2021, where the total number of vulnerabilities begins a sustained upward trend. This increase appears to be primarily driven by a rise in the absolute number of vulnerabilities across all severity levels, while the relative proportions of severity categories remain somewhat consistent.

## Conclusion

The graph indicates an evolving security landscape with an increasing discovery rate of vulnerabilities, suggesting either enhanced detection capabilities or growing complexity in technological systems. This trend underscores the importance of robust security measures and continuous monitoring in contemporary cybersecurity management.
