Thus we advise application developers to use this version of the\n+library. The vulnerabilities may lead to application crashes during ZRTP\n+negotiation if an attacker sends prepared ZRTP packets. The fixes remove these\n+attack vectors.\n+\n+Some small other enhancements and cleanup, mainly inside client code.\n+\n+Some enhancements in cache handling and the handling of retained shared\n+secrets. This change was proposed by Phil, is a slight security enhacement and\n+is fully backward comaptible.\n+\n+Because of some API changes clients must be compiled and linked with the new\n+library.\n+\n+For details please refer to the Git logs.\n+\n+\n+== GNU ZRTP 3.1.0 ==\n+\n+This version adds some new features and code that supports some other\n+client and this accounts for the most changes inside this release. \n+\n+The ZRTP core functionality was not changed as much (bug fixes, cleanup\n+mainly) and remains fully backward compatible with older library\n+versions. However, one nice enhancement was done: the addition of a standalone\n+SDES support module. This module supports basic SDES only without the fancy\n+stuff like many other SDES implementations. Thus it's pretty interoperable.\n+\n+Some other features are:\n+- add some android support for a client, may serve as template for others\n+- documentation and code cleanup\n+\n+Because of some API changes clients must be compiled and linked with the new\n+library.\n+\n+\n+== GNU ZRTP 3.0.0 ==\n+\n+This is a major enhancement and restructuring of the overall ZRTP\n+distribution. This was necessary because more and more other clients use ZRTP\n+and add their specific glue code. Also some clients are not prepared to use\n+openSSL or other crypto libraries to their code and distributions. \n+\n+Here a summary of the changes\n+- a new directory layout to accomodate various clients\n+- add standalone crypto modules, for example for AES, to have a real\n+  standalone ZRTP/SRTP library that does not require any other crypto library\n+  (optional via CMake configuration)\n+- Re-structure ZRTP cache and add SQlite3 as optional storage backend\n+\n+The default settings for CMake build the normal ZRTP library that use openSSL\n+as crypto backend, use the normal file based cache and include the GNU ccRTP\n+modules. This is a librray that is to a large degree compatible with the\n+earlier builds.\n+\n+Please refer to the top level CMakeFile.txt for options how to switch on the\n+standalone crypto mode or the SQlite3 based cache storage.\n+\n+\n+== GNU ZRTP 2.3.0 ==\n+\n+Add a \"paranoid\" mode to ZRTP. If and applications switches to this mode then\n+the ZRTP stack _always_ asks the user to confirm the SAS thus ZRTP behaves as\n+if it does not have a cache to store the retained secrets. However, setting\n+the paranoid mode does not diable the cache, only the GUI behaviour.\n+\n+Enhance the CMake scripts to build a ZRTP library that does not contain GNU\n+ccRTP modules and does not require ccRTP dependencies.\n+\n+== GNU ZRTP 2.2.0 ==\n+\n+Add stubs, callbacks and other provisions to prepare the full implementation\n+of the SAS signing feature, see RFC6189, section 7.2. This feature needs\n+support from applications and is rarely used if at all.\n+\n+As usual smaller fixes, code clean up etc.\n+\n+Because of some API changes clients must be compiled and linked with the new\n+library.\n+\n+== GNU ZRTP 2.1.2 ==\n+\n+The main topic of this release was to add SRTCP support and some missing\n+optional features of ZRTP. \n+\n+As such I've added some new API and classes that applications may use to add\n+SRTCP or to use the new ZRTP features. the ZRTP stack now supports PBX\n+handling, refer to RFC6189 section 7.3ff.\n+\n+Because of some API changes clients must be compiled and linked with the new\n+library.\n+\n == GNU ZRTP 2.0.0 ==\n \n Modify some files to use the new uCommon/commoncpp libraries instead"
