    "description": "Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 allow authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) URL value of an item or (2) user log history. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.",
