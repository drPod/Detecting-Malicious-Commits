    "description": "Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices suffers from an Unrestricted file upload vulnerability: 'network_ssl_upload.php' allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a direct request to the file in the upload/ directory. To authenticate for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext by leveraging the existing Local File Read Vulnerability referenced as CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the web-interface credentials via a request for the cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.",
