Thanks go to Matthijs Kooijman for discovering and\n+  reporting this issue and helping to review the fix.\n+\n+* Added a non-blocking collect_output() method to SSHClientProcess to\n+  allow applications to retrieve data received on an output stream\n+  without blocking. This call can be called multiple times and freely\n+  intermixed with regular read calls with a guarantee that output will\n+  always be returned in order and without duplication.\n+\n+* Updated debug logging implementation to make it more maintainable, and\n+  to fix an issue where unprocessed packets were not logged in some cases.\n+\n+* Extended the support below for non-ASCII characters in comments to apply\n+  to X.509 certificates, allowing an optional encoding to be passed in to\n+  get_comment() and set_comment() and a get_comment_bytes() function to\n+  get the raw comment bytes without performing Unicode decoding.\n+\n+* Fixed an issue where a UnicodeDecodeError could be reported in some\n+  cases instead of a KeyEncryptionError when a private key was imported\n+  using the wrong passphrase.\n+\n+* Fixed the reporting of the MAC algorithm selected during key exchange to\n+  properly report the cipher name for GCM and Chacha ciphers that don't\n+  use a separate MAC algorithm. The correct value was being returned in\n+  queries after the key exchange was complete, but the logging was being\n+  done before this adjustment was made.\n+\n+* Fixed the documentation of connection_made() in SSHSession subclasses\n+  to properly reflect the type of SSHChannel objects passed to them.\n+\n Release 1.12.0 (5 Feb 2018)\n ---------------------------\n "
