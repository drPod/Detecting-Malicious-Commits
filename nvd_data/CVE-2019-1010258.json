More severe impact vectors need more investigation. The component is: it's part of a svg processing library. function nsvg__parseColorRGB in src/nanosvg.h / line 1227. The attack vector is: It depends library usage. If input is passed from the network, then network connectivity is enough. Most likely an attack will require opening a specially crafted .svg file.",
