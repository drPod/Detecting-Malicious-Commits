    "description": "Multiple Zoho ManageEngine products suffer from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions for the %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\ManageEngine directory and its sub-folders. Moreover, the services associated with said products try to execute binaries such as sc.exe from the current directory upon system start. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. This affects Desktop Central 10.0.380, EventLog Analyzer 12.0.2, ServiceDesk Plus 10.0.0, SupportCenter Plus 8.1, O365 Manager Plus 4.0, Mobile Device Manager Plus 9.0.0, Patch Connect Plus 9.0.0, Vulnerability Manager Plus 9.0.0, Patch Manager Plus 9.0.0, OpManager 12.3, NetFlow Analyzer 11.0, OpUtils 11.0, Network Configuration Manager 11.0, FireWall 12.0, Key Manager Plus 5.6, Password Manager Pro 9.9, Analytics Plus 1.0, and Browser Security Plus.",
