The login_mgr.cgi file checks credentials against /etc/shadow. However, the \"nobody\" account (which can be used to access the control panel API as a low-privilege logged-in user) has a default empty password, allowing an attacker to modify the My Cloud EX2 Ultra web page source code and obtain access to the My Cloud as a non-Admin My Cloud device user.",
