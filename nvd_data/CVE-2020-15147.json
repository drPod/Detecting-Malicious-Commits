    "description": "Red Discord Bot before versions 3.3.12 and 3.4 has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Streams module. This exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted \"going live\" messages to inject code into the Streams module's going live message. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. As a workaround, unloading the Trivia module with `unload streams` can render this exploit not accessible. It is highly recommended updating to 3.3.12 or 3.4 to completely patch this issue.",
