    "description": "A component of Kaspersky custom boot loader allowed loading of untrusted UEFI modules due to insufficient check of their authenticity. This component is incorporated in Kaspersky Rescue Disk (KRD) and was trusted by the Authentication Agent of Full Disk Encryption in Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES). This issue allowed to bypass the UEFI Secure Boot security feature. An attacker would need physical access to the computer to exploit it. Otherwise, local administrator privileges would be required to modify the boot loader component.",
