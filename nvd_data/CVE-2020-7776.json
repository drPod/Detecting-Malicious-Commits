    "description": "This affects the package phpoffice/phpspreadsheet from 0.0.0. The library is vulnerable to XSS when creating an html output from an excel file by adding a comment on any cell. The root cause of this issue is within the HTML writer where user comments are concatenated as part of link and this is returned as HTML. A fix for this issue is available on commit 0ed5b800be2136bcb8fa9c1bdf59abc957a98845/master branch.",
