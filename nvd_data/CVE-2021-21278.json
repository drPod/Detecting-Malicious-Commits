    "description": "RSSHub is an open source, easy to use, and extensible RSS feed generator. In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.",
