    "description": "sopel-channelmgnt is a channelmgnt plugin for sopel. In versions prior to 2.0.1, on some IRC servers, restrictions around the removal of the bot using the kick/kickban command could be bypassed when kicking multiple users at once. We also believe it may have been possible to remove users from other channels but due to the wonder that is IRC and following RfCs, We have no POC for that. Freenode is not affected. This is fixed in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, do not use this plugin on networks where TARGMAX > 1.",
