    "description": "Tenancy multi-tenant is an open source multi-domain controller for the Laravel web framework. In some situations, it is possible to have open redirects where users can be redirected from your site to any other site using a specially crafted URL. This is only the case for installations where the default Hostname Identification is used and the environment uses tenants that have `force_https` set to `true` (default: `false`). Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix this bug. Stripping the URL from special characters to prevent specially crafted URL's from being redirected to. As a work around users can set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`, however this may degrade connection security.",
