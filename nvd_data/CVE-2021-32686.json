    "description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version 2.11.1.",
