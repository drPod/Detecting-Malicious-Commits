    "description": "Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.",
