    "description": "FlowDroid is a data flow analysis tool. FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition file.",
