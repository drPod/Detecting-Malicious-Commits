    "description": "Akaunting version 2.1.12 and earlier suffers from a password reset spoofing vulnerability, wherein an attacker can proxy password reset requests through a running Akaunting instance, if that attacker knows the target's e-mail address. This issue was fixed in version 2.1.13 of the product. Please note that this issue is ultimately caused by the defaults provided by the Laravel framework, specifically how proxy headers are handled with respect to multi-tenant implementations. In other words, while this is not technically a vulnerability in Laravel, this default configuration is very likely to lead to practically identical identical vulnerabilities in Laravel projects that implement multi-tenant applications.",
