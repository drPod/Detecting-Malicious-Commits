    "description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform The Nextcloud Mail application prior to versions 1.10.4 and 1.11.0 does by default not render images in emails to not leak the read state or user IP. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a relative protocol. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail application is upgraded to 1.10.4 or 1.11.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.",
