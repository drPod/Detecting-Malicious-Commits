    "description": "The WpGenius Job Listing WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/src/admin/class/class-wpgenious-job-listing-options.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0.2. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
