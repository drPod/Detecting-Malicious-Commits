    "description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that Grappler optimizer would attempt to build a tensor using a reference `dtype`. This would result in a crash due to a `CHECK`-fail in the `Tensor` constructor as reference types are not allowed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
