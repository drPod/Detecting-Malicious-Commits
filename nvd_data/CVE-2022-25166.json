    "description": "An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. It is possible to include a UNC path in the OpenVPN configuration file when referencing file paths for parameters (such as auth-user-pass). When this file is imported and the client attempts to validate the file path, it performs an open operation on the path and leaks the user's Net-NTLMv2 hash to an external server. This could be exploited by having a user open a crafted malicious ovpn configuration file.",
