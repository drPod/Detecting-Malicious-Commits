    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance` has incomplete validation. Users can pass negative values to cause a segmentation fault based denial of service. In multiple places throughout the code, one may compute an index for a write operation. However, the existing validation only checks against the upper bound of the array. Hence, it is possible to write before the array by massaging the input to generate negative values for `loc`. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.",
