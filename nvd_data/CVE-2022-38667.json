    "description": "HTTP applications (servers) based on Crow through 1.0+4 may allow a Use-After-Free and code execution when HTTP pipelining is used. The HTTP parser supports HTTP pipelining, but the asynchronous Connection layer is unaware of HTTP pipelining. Specifically, the Connection layer is unaware that it has begun processing a later request before it has finished processing an earlier request.",
