    "description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to remote code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent. The Spring RemoteInvocation endpoint exposed agent communication and allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects, as well as subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level authentication, thus an attacker would need to either compromise an existing agent, its network communication or register a new agent to practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.",
