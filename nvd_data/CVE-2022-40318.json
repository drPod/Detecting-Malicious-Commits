    "description": "An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) through 8.4. By crafting a BGP OPEN message with an option of type 0xff (Extended Length from RFC 9072), attackers may cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart, or out-of-bounds read). This is possible because of inconsistent boundary checks that do not account for reading 3 bytes (instead of 2) in this 0xff case. NOTE: this behavior occurs in bgp_open_option_parse in the bgp_open.c file, a different location (with a different attack vector) relative to CVE-2022-40302.",
