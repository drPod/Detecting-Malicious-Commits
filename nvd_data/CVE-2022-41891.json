    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat` is given `element_shape=[]`, it results segmentation fault which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
