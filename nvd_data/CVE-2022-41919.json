    "description": "Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type\u2019s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.",
