    "description": "The ntpd_driver component before 1.3.0 and 2.x before 2.2.0 for Robot Operating System (ROS) allows attackers, who control the source code of a different node in the same ROS application, to change a robot's behavior. This occurs because a topic name depends on the attacker-controlled time_ref_topic parameter.",
