This is specific to applications written in C#. This affects all MongoDB .NET/C# Driver versions prior to and including v2.18.0\n\nFollowing configuration must be true for the vulnerability to be applicable:  *  Application must written in C# taking arbitrary data from users and serializing data using _t without any validation AND\n  *  Application must be running on a Windows host using the full .NET Framework, not .NET Core AND\n  *  Application must have domain model class with a property/field explicitly of type System.Object or a collection of type System.Object (against MongoDB best practice) AND\n  *  Malicious attacker must have unrestricted insert access to target database to add a _t discriminator.\"Following configuration must be true for the vulnerability to be applicable\n\n\n\n",
