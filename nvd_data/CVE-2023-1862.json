    "description": "Cloudflare WARP client for Windows (up to v2023.3.381.0) allowed a malicious actor to remotely access the warp-svc.exe\u00a0binary due to an insufficient access control policy on an IPC Named Pipe. This would have enabled an attacker to trigger WARP connect and disconnect commands, as well as obtaining network diagnostics and application configuration from the target's device. It is important to note that in order to exploit this, a set of requirements would need to be met, such as the target's device must've been reachable on port 445, allowed authentication with NULL sessions or otherwise having knowledge of the target's credentials.\n\n",
