    "description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from a Nextcloud Server with your computer. Versions prior to 3.6.3 are missing sanitisation on qml labels which are used for basic HTML elements such as `strong`, `em` and `head` lines in the UI of the desktop client. The lack of sanitisation may allow for javascript injection. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop Client is upgraded to 3.6.3. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
