    "description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, when a specially crafted SIP message is processed by the function `rewrite_ruri`, a crash occurs due to a segmentation fault. This issue causes the server to crash. It affects configurations containing functions that make use of the affected code, such as the function `setport`. This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.",
