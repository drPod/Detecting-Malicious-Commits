    "description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. This issue only impacts users who have a HTTP policy that applies to multiple `toEndpoints` AND have an allow-all rule in place that affects only one of those endpoints. In such cases, a wildcard rule will be appended to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass of HTTP policies. This issue has been patched in Cilium 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2.",
