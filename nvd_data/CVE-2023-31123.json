    "description": "`effectindex/tripreporter` is a community-powered, universal platform for submitting and analyzing trip reports. Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`, may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually.",
