    "description": "league/oauth2-server is an implementation of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server written in PHP. Starting in version 8.3.2 and prior to version 8.5.3, servers that passed their keys to the CryptKey constructor as as string instead of a file path will have had that key included in a LogicException message if they did not provide a valid pass phrase for the key where required. This issue has been patched so that the provided key is no longer exposed in the exception message in the scenario outlined above. Users should upgrade to version 8.5.3 to receive the patch. As a workaround, pass the key as a file instead of a string.",
