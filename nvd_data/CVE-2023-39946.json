    "description": "eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6, heap can be overflowed by providing a PID_PROPERTY_LIST parameter that contains a CDR string with length larger than the size of actual content. In `eprosima::fastdds::dds::ParameterPropertyList_t::push_back_helper`, `memcpy` is called to first copy the octet'ized length and then to copy the data into `properties_.data`. At the second memcpy, both `data` and `size` can be controlled by anyone that sends the CDR string to the discovery multicast port. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. Versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6 contain a patch for this issue.",
