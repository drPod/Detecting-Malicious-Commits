    "description": "Arduino Create Agent is a package to help manage Arduino development. This vulnerability affects the endpoint `/upload` which handles request with the `filename` parameter. A user who has the ability to perform HTTP requests to the localhost interface, or is able to bypass the CORS configuration, can escalate their privileges to those of the user running the Arduino Create Agent service via a crafted HTTP POST request. This issue has been addressed in version `1.3.3`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
