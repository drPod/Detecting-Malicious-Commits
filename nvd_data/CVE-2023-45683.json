    "description": "github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victim\u2019s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata.",
