    "description": "In Eclipse RAP versions from 3.0.0 up to and including 3.25.0, Remote Code Execution is possible on Windows when using the FileUpload component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for this is a not completely secure extraction of the file name in the FileUploadProcessor.stripFileName(String name) method. As soon as this finds a / in the path, everything before it is removed, but potentially \\ (backslashes) coming further back are kept.\n\nFor example, a file name such as /..\\..\\webapps\\shell.war can be used to upload a file to a Tomcat server under Windows, which is then saved as ..\\..\\webapps\\shell.war in its webapps directory and can then be executed.\n\n\n",
