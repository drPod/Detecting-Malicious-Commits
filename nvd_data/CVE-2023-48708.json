    "description": "CodeIgniter Shield is an authentication and authorization provider for CodeIgniter 4. In affected versions successful login attempts are recorded with the raw tokens stored in the log table. If a malicious person somehow views the data in the log table they can obtain a raw token which can then be used to send a request with that user's authority. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable logging for successful login attempts by the configuration files.",
