    "description": "Cube is a semantic layer for building data applications. Prior to version 0.34.34, it is possible to make the entire Cube API unavailable by submitting a specially crafted request to a Cube API endpoint. The issue has been patched in `v0.34.34` and it's recommended that all users exposing Cube APIs to the public internet upgrade to the latest version to prevent service disruption.\nThere are currently no workaround for older versions, and the recommendation is to upgrade.",
