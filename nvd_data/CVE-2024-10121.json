    "description": "A vulnerability was found in wfh45678 Radar up to 1.0.8 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component Interface Handler. The manipulation with the input /../ leads to authorization bypass. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This appears not to be a path traversal weakness. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
