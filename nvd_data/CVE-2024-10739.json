    "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in code-projects E-Health Care System 1.0. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /Admin/adminlogin.php. The manipulation of the argument email/admin_pswd as part of String leads to sql injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter \"email\" to be affected. But it must be assumed that parameter \"admin_pswd\" is affected as well.",
