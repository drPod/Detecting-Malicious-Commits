    "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Musicshelf 1.0/1.1 on Android. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file io\\fabric\\sdk\\android\\services\\network\\PinningTrustManager.java of the component SHA-1 Handler. The manipulation leads to password hash with insufficient computational effort. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-256321 was assigned to this vulnerability.",
