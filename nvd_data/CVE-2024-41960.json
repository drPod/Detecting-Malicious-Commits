    "description": "mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. An authenticated admin user can inject a JavaScript payload into the Relay Hosts configuration. The injected payload is executed whenever the configuration page is viewed, enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to data theft, or further exploitation. This issue has been addressed in the `2024-07` release. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
