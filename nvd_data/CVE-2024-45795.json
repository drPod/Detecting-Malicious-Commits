    "description": "Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented \"unset\" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only trusted and well tested rulesets.",
