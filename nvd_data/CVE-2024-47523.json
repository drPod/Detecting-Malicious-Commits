    "description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"Alert Transports\" feature allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the \"Details\" section (which contains multiple fields depending on which transport is selected at that moment). This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.9.0.",
