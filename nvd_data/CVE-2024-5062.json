With this \n+integration, users can now connect ZenML with Prodigy and leverage its annotation capabilities \n+in their ML pipelines.\n+\n+## Retry configuration for steps\n+This release also includes new `retry` configuration for the steps. The following parameters \n+can be set:\n+\n+- _**max_retries**_: The maximum number of times the step should be retried in case of failure.\n+- _**delay**_: The initial delay in seconds before the first retry attempt.\n+- _**backoff**_: The factor by which the delay should be multiplied after each retry attempt.\n+\n+To use this in your code:\n+\n+```python\n+from zenml.config.retry_config import StepRetryConfig\n+\n+@step(retry=StepRetryConfig(max_retries=3, delay=10, backoff=2))\n+def step_3() -> None:\n+    # Step implementation\n+    raise Exception(\"This is a test exception\")\n+```\n+\n+or using a `config.yaml`:\n+\n+```yaml\n+steps:\n+  my_step:\n+    retry:\n+      max_retries: 3\n+      delay: 10\n+      backoff: 2\n+ ```\n+\n+In addition, this release includes a number of bug fixes and documentation updates, such\n+as a new LLM finetuning template powered by PEFT and BitsAndBytes and instructions for the\n+new annotators.\n+\n+\n+## Breaking changes\n+* The interface for the base class of the annotator stack component has been updated to \n+account for the fact that not all annotators will launch with a specific URL. So there is \n+no longer an url argument passed in.\n+\n+## \ud83e\udd73 Community Contributions \ud83e\udd73\n+\n+We'd like to give a special thanks to @christianversloot who contributed to this release \n+by bumping the `mlflow` version to 2.12.2\n+\n+## What's Changed\n+* Add more failure logs for code repositories and build reuse by @schustmi in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2697\n+* Prodigy annotator by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2655\n+* Bump mlflow support to version 2.12.2 by @christianversloot in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2693\n+* add 0.57.1 to migration test scripts by @safoinme in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2702\n+* Pigeon annotator by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2641\n+* Allow credentials expiry to be configured for service connectors by @stefannica in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2704\n+* Argilla annotator by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2687\n+* Add `MySQL` and `mariadb` migration tests to Slow CI by @safoinme in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2686\n+* Misc small fixes by @schustmi in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2712\n+* Allow resetting server and user metadata by @schustmi in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2666\n+* Fix Docker failures in the CI by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2716\n+* Add note about helm dependencies by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2709\n+* Add retry config for failing steps by @safoinme in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2627\n+* Update pyparsing version by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2710\n+* New ruff issue by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2718\n+* PEFT LLM Template by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2719\n+* Add `model_version_id` as part of the Model config by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2703\n+* Add more runners to fast CI by @safoinme in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2706\n+* Fail faster on notebook installation and only clone / download the branch we need for `zenml go` by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2721\n+* Make a clear separation between server and dashboard API in the server configuration by @stefannica in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2722\n+* Update pymysql to fix CVE-2024-36039 by @stefannica in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2714\n+* Allow specifying privileged mode for Kubernetes orchestrator containers by @schustmi in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2717\n+* Don't use pod resources/affinity for kubernetes orchestrator pod by @schustmi in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2707\n+* Extra test for artifact listing by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2715\n+* Pipeline run not tracked in cached artifact version by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2713\n+\n+\n+**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.57.1...0.58.0\n+\n+\n # 0.57.1\n \n This a minor release that brings a variety of enhancements for"

    "description": "A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in zenml-io/zenml version 0.57.1. The vulnerability exists due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically within the survey redirect parameter. This flaw allows an attacker to redirect users to a specified URL after completing a survey, without proper validation of the 'redirect' parameter. Consequently, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session. This vulnerability could be exploited to steal cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.",
