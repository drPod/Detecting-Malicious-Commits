    "description": "Osmedeus is a Workflow Engine for Offensive Security. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occurs on the Osmedues web server when viewing results from the workflow, allowing commands to be executed on the server. When using a workflow that contains the summary module, it generates reports in HTML and Markdown formats. The default report is based on the `general-template.md` template.The contents of the files are read and used to generate the report. However, the file contents are not properly filtered, leading to XSS. This may lead to commands executed on the host as well. This issue is not yet resolved. Users are advised to add their own filtering or to reach out to the developer to aid in developing a patch.",
