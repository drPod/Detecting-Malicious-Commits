    "description": "Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. In affected versions a bug in Astro\u2019s CSRF-protection middleware allows requests to bypass CSRF checks. When the `security.checkOrigin` configuration option is set to `true`, Astro middleware will perform a CSRF check. However, a vulnerability exists that can bypass this security. A semicolon-delimited parameter is allowed after the type in `Content-Type`. Web browsers will treat a `Content-Type` such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; abc` as a `simple request` and will not perform preflight validation. In this case, CSRF is not blocked as expected. Additionally, the `Content-Type` header is not required for a request. This issue has been addressed in version 4.16.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
