    "description": "Socialstream is a third-party package for Laravel Jetstream. It replaces the published authentication and profile scaffolding provided by Laravel Jetstream, with scaffolding that has support for Laravel Socialite. When linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if ->stateless() is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks. Socialstream v6.2 introduces a new custom route that requires a user to \"Confirm\" or \"Deny\" a request to link a social account. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
